Boot Up the Application (23_JAN_2023/oauth/tut-spring-boot-oauth2/simple)
With that change, you can run your app again and visit the home page at http://localhost:8080. 
Now, instead of the home page, you should be redirected to login with GitHub. 
If you do that, and accept any authorizations you are asked to make, 
you will be redirected back to the local app, and the home page will be visible.

If you stay logged in to GitHub, 
you won't have to re-authenticate with this local app, 
even if you open it in a fresh browser with no cookies and no cached data. 
(Thatâ€™s what Single Sign-On means.)
