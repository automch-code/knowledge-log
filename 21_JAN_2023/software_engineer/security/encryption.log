There are many types of encryption, including symmetric-key encryption, asymmetric-key encryption, and hashing.

Symmetric-key encryption, 
  also known as secret key encryption, uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Examples of symmetric-key encryption algorithms include AES and DES.

Asymmetric-key encryption,
  also known as public key encryption, uses a pair of keys - one for encryption and one for decryption. Examples of asymmetric-key encryption algorithms include RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

Hashing is a one-way process that generates a fixed-size output for a given input, called a hash or a digest. Examples of hashing algorithms include SHA-256 and MD5.

Overall, the choice of encryption method depends on the use case and the level of security required.

Symmetric-key encryption flow

The flow of symmetric-key encryption typically involves the following steps:

Key Generation: 
  A secret key is generated and shared between the sender and the receiver.
  The key is used for both encryption and decryption.

Encryption:
  The sender uses the secret key to encrypt the plaintext message.
  This produces the ciphertext, which is sent to the receiver.

Transmission:
  The ciphertext is transmitted over a network or stored on a device.

Decryption:
  The receiver uses the secret key to decrypt the ciphertext and recover the original plaintext message.

It's important to keep the secret key secure and only share it with authorized parties, 
as anyone with the key can decrypt the ciphertext and access the original message.

Another important point is that symmetric encryption is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack, 
so the key has to be securely exchanged before the communication, which is done by asymmetric encryption.
