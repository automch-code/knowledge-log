Password-based authentication มีอะไรบ้าง

Basic authentication:
  This is the simplest form of password-based authentication,
  where a user enters a username and password in plain text,
  which is then sent over the network for verification.

Digest authentication:
  This method is similar to basic authentication,
  but the password is first encoded using a one-way hashing algorithm,
  such as MD5 or SHA-1, before it is sent over the network.

Salted password hashing:
  This method uses a one-way hashing algorithm
  along with a randomly generated string of characters (salt) to improve security.
  This makes it harder for an attacker to use precomputed tables of hashed password,
  known as "Rainbow tables".

Hashed and salted with key derivation function:
  This method uses a combination of salted password hashing and
  key derivation function, such as bcrypt, scrypt and Argon2.

ข้อดี ข้อเสีย ของ Password-based authentication

Basic authentication:
Pros: Simple to implement and widely supported by web browsers and servers.
Cons: Passwords are sent in plain text and can be easily intercepted by attackers.

Digest authentication:
Pros: Passwords are hashed before they are sent over the network, making them more secure than basic authentication.
Cons: Hashing algorithms can be cracked, and the digest can be replayed by an attacker.

Salted password hashing:
Pros: The use of a unique salt value for each password makes it more difficult for attackers to use precomputed tables to crack the password.
Cons: Salted password hashing can still be vulnerable to attacks such as dictionary attacks, where an attacker tries a large number of words as a password.

Hashed and salted with key derivation function:
Pros: The use of key derivation functions, such as bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2, makes it more difficult for an attacker to crack the password.
Cons: Key derivation functions are computationally expensive and can add extra overhead to the authentication process.
